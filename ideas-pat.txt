
MonoGame Functionality

Functionality We Have
Panel class

Functionality That Would Likely Be Useful
- Rendering text easily
- Text panels.  These can be combined with the UI Panel class.
- Textboxes
- Bar meters - simple but fairly versatile would be nice


Here is a sample MonoGame platformer game project where there is object to tile
collision detection with what I believe is the kind of handling I am looking for.
