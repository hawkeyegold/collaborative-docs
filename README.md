todo-list

Document to keep track of things that have been identified as "something to do" either 
through organic development in threads and personal conversations, or items selected
from an idea list.

The idea here is that anything that gets on this list will be something that has
graduated beyond the point of speculation/research/consideration and has largely
presented as something that will become a project.

Optimally, discussion regarding items on this list would be more practical in
nature
