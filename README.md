#Overview#
[./overview.txt](overview.txt)

Document to generally state the purpose and overall scope of this repository as 
a whole.  This document will likely be fairly static, though it might also serve
as a good place to list any collaborative or shared repositories.  It should also 
be edited accordingly if the scope or nature of the repository itself were to
expand, or otherwise evolve.


#To Do List#
[./todo-list.txt](todo-list.txt)

Document to keep track of things that have been identified as "something to do" either 
through organic development in threads and personal conversations, or items selected
from an idea list.

The idea here is that anything that gets on this list will be something that has
graduated beyond the point of speculation/research/consideration and has largely
presented as something that will become a project.

Optimally, discussion regarding items on this list would be more practical in
nature and implementative in nature and targeted less towards theoretical or 
conceptual.


#Ideas Files#
[./ideas-pat.txt](ideas-pat.txt) / [./ideas-dave.txt](ideas-dave.txt)

Documents to just hold random ideas, musings, intrigues that generally related 
to the stated overview of this project or any of the tracked projects related to
to it, as listed in the overview.


#Doing List#
[./doing-list.txt](doing-list.txt)

Document to track what either of us is currently working on, in relationship to 
this initiative.


#Completed List#
[./completed-list.txt](completed-list.txt)

Document to list completed projects/initiatives et al.


#Idea Archive Folder#

Sort of a mad scientist Folder for ideas that for the time being would serve to
clutter the existing workspace but would be good to preserve.  Ideas here need not 
have a related project, and in fact most likely won't.
